**_This is my daughter's favorite game!_**

In this game, your objective is to reach the 'target number'.

Click a gem to begin adding to your current score. Each gem is given a random value which changes with every iteration of the game.

BE CAREFUL: if you go over the target, you lose!

This game uses jQuery and Bootstrap
